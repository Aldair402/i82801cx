I need to add this for my coreboot port but since i dont have fucking idea what im dooing, i upload my code here so i test it in my lab machine

Many values, ids are for the ICH4, im going to do a lscpi or check the linux kernel later to update these. there are also some texts that need to be replaced. and maybe i killed usb.c
